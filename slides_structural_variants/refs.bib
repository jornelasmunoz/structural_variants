@article{SPENCE202061,
	abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) are a class of genomic variation shared by members of the same species. Though relatively rare, they represent an increasingly important class of variation, as SVs have been associated with diseases and susceptibility to some types of cancer. Common approaches to SV detection require the sequencing and mapping of fragments from a test genome to a high-quality reference genome. Candidate SVs correspond to fragments with discordant mapped configurations. However, because errors in the sequencing and mapping will also create discordant arrangements, many of these predictions will be spurious. When sequencing coverage is low, distinguishing true SVs from errors is even more challenging. In recent work, we have developed SV detection methods that exploit genome information of closely related individuals -- parents and children. Our previous approaches were based on the assumption that any SV present in a child's genome must have come from one of their parents. However, using this strict restriction may have resulted in failing to predict any rare but novel variants present only in the child. In this work, we generalize our previous approaches to allow the child to carry novel variants. We consider a constrained optimization approach where variants in the child are of two types either inherited - and therefore must be present in a parent -- or novel. For simplicity, we consider only a single parent and single child each of which have a haploid genome. However, even in this restricted case, our approach has the power to improve variant prediction. We present results on both simulated candidate variant regions, parent-child trios from the 1000 Genomes Project, and a subset of the 17 Platinum Genomes.},

@article{1000GenomesProject_2010,
	abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother--father--child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95{\%} of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10−8 per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},
