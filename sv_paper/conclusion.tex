% Conclusion
We present an optimization method for detecting both structural variants and their genotype (homozygous or heterozygous) from low-coverage DNA sequencing data in related individuals. This method leverages Mendelian inheritance to improve signal reconstruction of noisy data. This extends previous work that focused on a Poisson-based optimization algorithm. We compare our method to SPIRAL and applied them to simulated data to reconstruct heterozygous and homozygous signals. Overall, we achieve improved precision rates for total SV detection with our method.
In future studies, we intend to apply this work to a two parent and one child framework.
